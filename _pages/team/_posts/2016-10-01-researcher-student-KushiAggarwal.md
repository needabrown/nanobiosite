Kushi joined the NanoBio lab at the University of Central Florida in August 2025 as a graduate research assistant. She was born and raised in Andhra Pradesh, India. She earned my bachelor's degree in biotechnology from Vellore Institute of Technology before moving to the USA to pursue higher education. During my masterâ€™s program, she conducted research on nano-therapeutics for ovarian cancer. After completing her degree, she gained two years of industry experience, where she worked on the development of oncolytic viral therapies for cancer. In parallel, she also contributed to advancing CAR-T cell therapy initiatives as part of a team. Looking ahead, she aims to deepen her understanding of diverse therapeutic approaches and focus on developing cancer treatments from multiple perspectives.
