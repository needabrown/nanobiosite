Dr. Ramji Kandel is a Postdoctoral Fellow with experience in molecular and mechanistic toxicology. His research focuses on the role of oxidative stress and epigenetic regulation in kidney injury, fibrosis, and cancer biology. Dr. Kandel employs a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and emerging ex vivo models to uncover the pathways that drive toxicant-induced pathologies. His work has resulted in several peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national conferences, offering mechanistic insights into how toxicants and antioxidants influence kidney disease processes. In addition to his research, he is committed to mentorship, teaching, and professional service, actively contributing to the scientific community through leadership roles and participation in conferences.
