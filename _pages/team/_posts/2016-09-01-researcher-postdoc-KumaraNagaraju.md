Dr. Kumara received his master’s degree in organic chemistry from Govt. Science College, Bangalore, India in the year 2017. After 1.5 years of industrial experience, he joined Yenepoya University to pursue his Ph.D. His research focused on the synthesis of carbonaceous nanomaterials and their toxicity evaluations through in vitro studies, development of nanomedicine and fabrication of soft contact lenses to treat ocular diseases. In the year 2024, Kumara joined Colorado School of Mines as a postdoc to strengthen his skills in contact lens based therapeutic delivery. In addition, he also focused on developing novel nano-formulations to enhance the therapeutic potential of contact lens to treat various ocular disorders. Currently, at NanoBio Lab, he is focusing on nanoparticle synthesis and their surface passivation strategies, and liposomal formulations to treat breast and ovarian cancer.
