### Postdoctoral Fellow

The NanoBio Lab in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering is seeking a Post Doctoral Scholar. This scholar will work on a project that intersects the interdisciplinary fields of nanomedicine and oncology with a focus on how nanomaterials can be engineered for drug delivery of clinically relevant small molecules for DNA damage and immune response activation. As a member of the research team, the scholar will actively pursue research under the supervision of the principal investigator while developing expertise for independent work and promote innovation of ideas. The lab is seeking a talented and motivated scholar who will contribute to the goal of translational research and discovery.

#### The scholar in this role will be responsible for:
- The formulation and characterization of biodegradable implants and nanoparticles (thin-film hydration, HPLC, SEM/TEM, DLS/zeta, etc).
- Conducting cell-based and molecular biology research aimed at understanding the biological response of nanomaterials and tumor/immune cells (western blot, MTS, PCR, confocal microscopy, etc).
- Conducting in vivo studies to understand the impact of nanoformulated drug delivery platforms on survival, toxicity, biodistribution, immune infiltration (flow cytometry), immunohistochemistry, etc.
- Preparing and publishing high-impact scientific manuscripts with opportunities to participate in proposal development and present work at national conferences.
- Developing expertise in desired lab skills/informatics/physics/clinical research.
- Developing proficiency in necessary research tools and equipment.
- Supervising and training of graduate (Ph.D. & M.S.) and undergraduate (B.S.) students.
- Building on existing clinical collaborations with domestic and international hospitals and research institutes.
