## Join the <font color="red">N</font>ano<font color="red">B</font>io Team!

### Postdoctoral Fellow

The NanoBio Lab in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering is seeking a Post Doctoral Scholar. This scholar will work on a project that intersects the interdisciplinary fields of nanomedicine, oncology, and infectious disease with a focus on how nanomaterials can be engineered for drug delivery of clinically relevant small molecules for DNA damage and immune response activation. As a member of the research team, the scholar will actively pursue research under the supervision of the principal investigator while developing expertise for independent work and promote innovation of ideas. The lab is seeking a talented and motivated scholar who will contribute to the goal of translational research and discovery.

Prospective postdoctoral fellows with backgrounds in Materials Science & Engineering, Nanotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Nanomedicine, Biomedical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chemical Engineering or other related fields, who are interested is tackling biomedial problems with nanomaterial solutions are welcome to reach out (<needa.brown@ucf.edu>).

### Graduate Research Assistant

Interested PhD and Masters students already enrolled in a graduate program at University of Central Florida are specially encouraged to contact Dr. Brown  (<needa.brown@ucf.edu>) for available positions and/or lab rotations opportunities.

Prospective graduate students with backgrounds in Materials Science & Engineering, Nanotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Nanomedicine, Biomedical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chemical Engineering or other related fields, who are interested is tackling biomedial problems with nanomaterial solutions are welcome to reach out (<needa.brown@ucf.edu>).

### Undergraduate Students

Highly motivated undergraduate students are urged to reach out to Dr. Brown (<needa.brown@ucf.edu>)to discuss potential projects!
