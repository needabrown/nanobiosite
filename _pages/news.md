### We are funded - Biomaterial solutions for breast cancer!
#### August 1, 2023

The NanoBio Lab was just awarded a CDMRP Breast Cancer Resarch Program Breakthrough Level II award with Partnering-PI, Jennifer Guerriero, at Brigham and Women's Hospital to develop "Sustained release STING agonist implants activate antitumor immunity to treat advanced breast cancer in combination with PARPi". The objective of this work is to generate preclinical data that will provide a strong rationale for a sustained STING agonist delivery method that is the major breakthrough necessary for clinical translation of STING agonist as a curative strategy for advanced, metastatic breast cancer.

### We are funded - Nanoformulations to tackle metastatic ovarian cancer!
#### July 1, 2023

The NanoBio Lab was just awarded a CDMRP Ovarian Cancer Resarch Program Pilot Award award with Co-Investigator, Srinivas Sridhar, at Northeastern University to develop "Combination Intraperitoneal Local Delivery of PARPi Implants and Anti-PDL1". The proposed study seeks to develop effective combinations of sustained release TLZ implants with immunomodulatory factors, anti-PDL1 and STING agonist, to overcome PARPi resistance and minimize systemic toxicity in a patient-mimicking, peritoneal metastatic high grade serous ovarian cancer model.
